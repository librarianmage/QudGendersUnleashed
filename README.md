# Qud: Genders Unleashed

A mod that works in conjunction with the [Gender and Pronoun Sets](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1735379738) mod to provide a plethora of genders and pronouns for your game character.

Specifically, this mod allows you to pick from all personal genders and pronouns defined in game (including pseudo-plural ones), with a number of additions.

Additionally, all gender and pronoun prompts have been redesigned with inspirations from kernelmethod's [Better Pet Selector](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3006503292) mod.

Tested to work on game versions 204.100 / 205.54 (beta).

## Wishes

The wishes `changegender` and `changepronouns` have been added for quick access while playing.

## `=name=` Pronoun Sets

Starting with version 1.1, `=name=` in a pronoun set will be dynamically replaced with the player character's name (`=name's=` with the possessive version). To demonstrate this, a pronoun set consisting completely of `=name=` and `=name's=` has been added.
