# Qud: Genders Unleashed

A mod that works in conjunction with the [Gender and Pronoun Sets](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1735379738) mod to allow your delver to wreathe themselves in the gender identity and pronouns they feel most comfortable in.

Specifically, this mod allows you to pick from all personal genders and pronouns defined in game (including pseudo-plural ones), with a number of additions.

Additionally, the "choose pronoun" prompt in game has been modified to use the modern UI. This will facilitate picking from the extended list this mod provides.

*`=name=` pronoun sets:* Starting with version 1.1, `=name=` in a pronoun set will be dynamically replaced with the player character's name (`=name's=` with the possessive version). To demonstrate this, a pronoun set consisting completely of `=name=` and `=name's=` has been added.

Tested to work on game version 203.54
